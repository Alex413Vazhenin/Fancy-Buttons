# 1---Fancy-Buttons

My take on 30 day CSS challenge from FreeCodeCamp.
Day 1. Fancy buttons!
List of created buttons:
- 2 facebook styled buttons: light and dark versions
- 1 gradient button
- 2 animated buttons
- 2 toggle switches

I haven't completed 3d buttons and second gradient button, because they're too out of place for most modern sites.
